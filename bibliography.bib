	abstract = {Aggregate computing is an emerging approach to the engineering of complex coordination for distributed systems, based on viewing system interactions in terms of 	information propagating through collectives of devices, rather than in terms of individual devices and their interaction with their peers and environment. The foundation of this 	approach is the distillation of a number of prior approaches, both formal and pragmatic, proposed under the umbrella of field-based coordination, and culminating into the field 	calculus, a universal functional programming model for the specification and composition of collective behaviours with equivalent local and aggregate semantics. This foundation has 	been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing 	reusable libraries of program components. Furthermore, some of these components are formally shown to satisfy formal properties like self-stabilisation, which transfer to whole 	application services by functional composition. In this survey, we trace the development and antecedents of field calculus, review the field calculus itself and the current state 	of aggregate computing theory and practice, and discuss a roadmap of current research directions with implications for the development of a broad range of distributed systems.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a fiducial marker system specially appropriated for camera pose estimation in applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Three 	main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the 	inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can 	have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality 	applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains 	dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.}
